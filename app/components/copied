    <p class="p">
        In order to fulfil God’s plan for your life,
         you must establish clear priorities and live by them each day
         . Author Edward de Bono quipped, ‘A conclusion is the place where
          you get tired of thinking.’ Sadly, many people arrive at priorities based
           on where they ran out of steam. You definitely don’t want to do that.
            Nor do you want to allow others to decide your agenda or your priorities.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
             Many ways exist for determining priorities. First, and foremost, your 
             plan must always line up with God’s will for you (see Hebrews 13;20-21).
              Jesus said, ‘I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear 
              fruit, and   your frit should ramin.’Observe:1)You must know that God
               has chosen you and appointed you  to a particular area of service.2) 
               Your goal in life should be fruit that remains after you .If you them 
               properly,  things like money and influence can aid you , but they must 
               never be your goal or your heart’s desire.</p>
               <p class="p"> So, how can you establish 
               the right priorities? As you get to know yourself better, begin focusing
                on your strengths and the things that make best use of your God-given 
                skills. Consider what brings you the highest return and reward. Think
                 about what you enjoy most and do best. Those are your core gifts. 
                   Utilize the 80/20 rule. Give 80 per cent of your effort to the 20 
                   per cent of your activities. Bottom line: Jesus said you are to give
                    your attention to  the areas that bear the most-fruit.
